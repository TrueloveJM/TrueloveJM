### Hi, my name is Josiah Truelove 

I am 25 years old, still a bit of youngster, but I am getting much much older much much quicker than I would have ever expected.
I am school, and I think at this point I'm either a junior or senior. I have trouble figuring out exactly what the university considers
me. See I started my educational journey with a bachelors in math, that I did not finish, because I decided that it was going to be
difficult to get a job as a teacher teaching math, unless I did something drastic to stick out and be ahead of everyone else,
but even at that point, I decided that I didn't really want to teach high school anymore, and that my desires had changed, and I 
had seen some of what is considered Master's and Doctorral level math and I just didn't like it. SO! I changed to a degree in
computer science, with a concentration in Information Technology. I figured if I can't beat them join them, right? Anyway,
this gig is a little harder than math, but it's a lot more fun and promising, it's a humungous industry and I really like a lot of
the people and assignments, just down to earth people wanting to help students. I figured worse comes to worse, I can start a 
business setting up older people's computers or even repairing hardware. Either way, my dream would be making a video game,
but I have a lot of trouble with doing projects unless I have some sort of pressure behind it in order to make it a necessary
for me in my life, and I'm not in it for the money, I just love computers! My favorite hobby would definitely be video games,
but I also thoroughly enjoy some good Television. I don't watch as much television or play as many video games anymore though,
simply because I don't have as much time as I used to. One of my favorite things to do is buy a new part for my computer and..
well.. put it in my computer, and then boot it up and see the changes :) ...
